<h2>Linux Command Reference Page</h2>
<h3>"Echo"</h3>
<p>The Echo command will repeat what follows it in the next line. If you would like text to appear, echo is a great way to do this. A common use of Echo is "$ Echo $?" which returns a 0 if your last command ran successfully, and a 1 if it didn't</p>
<h3>"Rm"</h3>
<p>The RM function is used to delete a file. When you use the command RM followed by the name of a file, that file is deleted from the respective directory. A common use of this is "$ RM -i (filename)." this command will allow the user to confirm the deletion before it's completed.</p>
<h3>"Nano"</h3>
<p>The Nano command allows the user to open or create a file in nano. This is especially helpful when you want to store code that you have created or some sort of text. A common use of this command is "$ nano (newfilename)" to create a document in which you can store information.</p>
<h3>"Date"</h3>
<p>The Date command, when used alone, spits out the current date and time. A common use might be "$ Date --date="yesterday" with any amount of time where yesterday is in order to find a specific time on a day. </p>
<h3>"Ls -al"</h3>
<p>This command shows all directories in the current user in the system. The most common reason this command is used (as it is often used as just "$ ls -al") is to see is a command is executable. If it is not executable, the next command is used.</p>
<h3>"Chmod"</h3>
<p>The chmod command allows the user to change the executable status of a specific directory/file. For example, a user might run "$ chmod 755 (filename)" in order to give themselves the ability to "./" (aka run) a file.</p>
<h3>"Ps"</h3>
<p>The Ps command allows the user to see all processes that are currently running within Linux. By using the common form of "$ ps r," the user would be able to identify the running programs and use the next command to kill the ones that they must stop (if any).</p>
<h3>"Kill"</h3>
<p>The kill command stops any program that is currently running from running, assuming the user has the correct authority to do this. The common form of "$ kill -9 (processname)" will force kill the running of any process the user chooses.</p>
<h3>"Hostname"</h3>
<p>The Hostname command allows the user to identify their space within the system within which they are running. The most common form of "$ hostname" simply displays the user's information under which Linux is running.</p>
<h3>"History"</h3>
<p>The History command shows all previous command run in Linux so that the user can go back and see if they made any mistakes. A common form, "$ history | tail -(#)," will show the previous processes while omitting the designated "#" of last commands.</p>
